# ----- Mouse actions ---------------------------------------------------------
# https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/#mouse-actions

# Mouse buttons can be remapped to perform arbitrary actions. The
# syntax for doing so is:

# .. code-block:: none

#     mouse_map button-name event-type modes action

# Where ``button-name`` is one of ``left``, ``middle``, ``right`` or
# ``b1 ... b8`` with added keyboard modifiers, for example:
# ``ctrl+shift+left`` refers to holding the ctrl+shift keys while
# clicking with the left mouse button. The number ``b1 ... b8`` can
# be used to refer to upto eight buttons on a mouse.

# ``event-type`` is one ``press``, ``release``, ``doublepress``,
# ``triplepress``, ``click`` and ``doubleclick``.  ``modes``
# indicates whether the action is performed when the mouse is grabbed
# by the program running in the terminal, or not. It can have one or
# more or the values, ``grabbed,ungrabbed``. ``grabbed`` refers to
# when the program running in the terminal has requested mouse
# events. Note that the click and double click events have a delay of
# click_interval to disambiguate from double and triple presses.

# You can run kitty with the kitty --debug-input command line option
# to see mouse events. See the builtin actions below to get a sense
# of what is possible.

# If you want to unmap an action map it to ``no-op``. For example, to
# disable opening of URLs with a plain click::

#     mouse_map left click ungrabbed no-op

# .. note::
#     Once a selection is started, releasing the button that started it will
#     automatically end it and no release event will be dispatched.

# clear_all_mouse_actions no

# You can have kitty remove all mouse actions seen up to this point.
# Useful, for instance, to remove the default mouse actions.

# mouse_map left            click ungrabbed mouse_click_url_or_select
# mouse_map shift+left      click grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_click_url_or_select
# mouse_map ctrl+shift+left release grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_click_url

# Variant with ctrl+shift is present because the simple click based
# version has an unavoidable delay of click_interval, to disambiguate
# clicks from double clicks.

# mouse_map ctrl+shift+left press grabbed discard_event

# Prevent this press event from being sent to the program that has
# grabbed the mouse, as the corresponding release event is used to
# open a URL.

# mouse_map middle        release ungrabbed paste_from_selection
# mouse_map left          press ungrabbed mouse_selection normal
# mouse_map ctrl+alt+left press ungrabbed mouse_selection rectangle
# mouse_map left          doublepress ungrabbed mouse_selection word
# mouse_map left          triplepress ungrabbed mouse_selection line

# Select the entire line

# mouse_map ctrl+alt+left triplepress ungrabbed mouse_selection line_from_point

# Select from the clicked point to the end of the line

# mouse_map right press ungrabbed mouse_selection extend

# If you want only the end of the selection to be moved instead of
# the nearest boundary, use move-end instead of extend.
